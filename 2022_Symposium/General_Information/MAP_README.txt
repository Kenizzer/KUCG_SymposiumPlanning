Interactive maps can be made on Google Maps, if they are linked to a Google email account. Go to "Google Maps", then click on the menu button (3 lines on the left side near the search bar). Under 'Your Places' > 'Maps' tab, you can 'Create Map' at the bottom of the menu. You can then add in points by searching them and clicking 'Add to map'. You can change the layers to get different levels of detail. You can edit each point (icon, colour, name) and put them into categories. Although it has to be linked to an account, when you go to "Share map", you can deselect the 'Let others see your name and photo on this map'. You can also 'Print map' on the menu, where you can export it to PDF.
