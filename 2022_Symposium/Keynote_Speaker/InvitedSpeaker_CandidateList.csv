Jon Sanders,https://cihmid.cornell.edu/?people=jon-sanders,"Bacteria, microbiome, ecology and evolution, genomics, phylogenomics",Jon is a postdoc at Cornell in the Moeller lab. He does research on the microbiota of diverse animal taxa using a comparative phylogenetic perspective. His current work is focused on understanding the genomic evolutionary history of gut bacteria in deer mice. His overall aim is to understand the genomic basis of host specificity in mammalian microbiomes. He currently holds a CIHMID Fellowship at Cornell.,"Wen-Juan Ma (2), Justin Tackney (2)"
Alice Baniel,https://smack-lab.com/alice-baniel/,"evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, primate gut microbiomes, sexual selection, parental care","Alice is a postdoc at Arizona State, jointly working with the Snyder-Mackler (ASU) and Lu (Stony Brook University) labs. She is generally interested in life history strategies and sexual selection in primates. Her PhD work was at Montpellier in France, and focused on sexual conflict in wild baboons. Her current work focuses on the interaction between microbiome and premature weaning on the health of wild geladas (old world monkey in Africa). She's had several recent papers on early life gut microbiome development in geladas with respect to maternal and environmental factors. ","Kristie Beaty (2), Jessie Perlmutter, paris Veltsos (2), Stefan Cerbin (2)"
Lauren Petrullo ,https://www.laurenapetrullo.com/,"Evolution, adaptive plasticity, non-human primate and other mammalian microbiomes, gut-brain axis, biological anthropology","Lauren is a postdoc at U. Michigan in the Dantzer lab. She is broadly interested in the role of the microbiome in development of mammals, the gut-brain axis, and the mechanisms and evolution of adaptive plasticity. Her formal education was in biological anthropology. Her PhD work focused on maturation of the gut microbiome in non-human primates. Her postdoc work is focused on the red squirrel developmental microbiome with respect to maternal effects, ecology, and adaptation. She has a large body of work recently published in the last few years on early life microbiomes in vervet and gelada monkeys. She currently has an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship.","Justin Tackney(1), Jessie Perlmutter (1), Kristie Beaty (1), Elizabeth Everman (2), Patrick Lansdon (2), Nichole Ginnan (2)"
John Brooks,https://hooperlab.org/members/index.html,,"(this is Rob so I'm probably not supposed to be involved) John Brooks earned his Ph.D. in microbiology from Northwestern University in Chicago, where his research focused on the colonization dynamics of the Hawaiian bobtail squid symbiont, Vibrio fischeri . His current research is to understand how the circadian clock influences microbiota function in the gut. Outside of the lab, John enjoys running, watching HGTV, and eating Texan BBQ.",David Ingham (2)
Helen Vuong,https://www.helenvuongphd.com/,"Microbiome, neurodevelopment, behavior","Helen is a postdoc at UCLA in the Hsiao lab. Her research interests focus on how host-microbe interactions regulate bacterial colonization, brain development and activity, and behaviors in health and disease. She currently has a K99/R00 pathway to independence award to study how maternal gut microbes impact fetal neurodevelopment.","David Ingham (1), Wen-Juan Ma (1), Nichole Ginnan (1), Elizabeth Everman (1), Patrick Lansdon (1), Paris Veltsos (1), Stefan Cerbin (1)"
Ryan Bracewell,https://www.ryanbracewell.com/research.html,Symbiosis and coevolution; Chromosome evolution and speciation; Behavior evolution and speciation,"Ryan's reserach interestes are very broad, across symbiosis, behavior speciation and chromosome evolution, using beetles, Drosophila, and other insects as study systems. He has published >16 influential results in these fields in well respected genetic, evolution and genomics journals such as Nature Ecolocoy and Evolution, fields in well respected genetic, evolution and genomics journals such as Nature Ecolocoy and Evolution, Nature Communication, Molecular Biology and Evolution et al. He has also got various awards and grants, including NIH NRSA F32 postdoc fellowship, USDA AFRI NIFA grant, McIntire-Stennis grant, among many others. ","Wen-Juan Ma,"

Laura Grieneisen,https://www.lauragrieneisen.com/,"Microbial ecology, host-associated microbiomes, primate microbiomes, host genetics and social behavoir","Laura Grieneisen is a postdoc at the University of Minnesota in Ran Blekhman' lab. In general, her research focuses on using wild animals to study host-associated microbiota in relation to host genetics, ecology, etc. and aims to understand how host microbiome shifts relate to various health outcomes. Currently, she is studying host genetics and social behavior effects on the microbiomes of wild baboon populations in Kenya. She has published over a dozen articles related to gut microbiomes in primates and holds a Grand Challenges in Biology Fellowship. She published a really interesting article this summer investigating the relative contribution of host genetics vs shared environments in the similarity of microbiomes from related individuals.","Jessie Perlmutter, Nichole Ginnan, Kristie Beaty, Lauren Norman, Justin Tackney, Elizabeth Everman"
Samantha C. Lewis,https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/samantha-lewis,"mitochondrial biogenesis and genome inheritance, organell assembly, DNA replication, cell metabolism, ","Dr Lewis is a young PI at UC Berkley who has completed excellent work in mitochondrial genomics. Samantha completed her PhD in Genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics at UC Riverside and is interested in understanding michondrial DNA inheritance, mechanisms of maintaining mtDNA integrity and how failure in these metabolomic systems can result in disease. Most recently, she has received a F32 NRSA, and K99 pathway to independence award. ",David Ingham
Jesse Engreitz,https://www.engreitzlab.org/,"single-cell genomics, enhancer-gene communication, computational modeleling of genome regulation","Dr. Jesse Engreitz is an early career investigator at Stanford University whose research focuses on the assembly of gene regulatory maps to uncover biological mechanisms of human disease. Jesse obtained his PhD from MIT and completed his postdoctoral training at the Broad Institute. He has multiple first and last author contributions to top-tier journals including Nature, Nature Genetics, Science and Cell. He received a K99/R00 pathway to independence award in 2018 and joined Stanford University as faculty in 2020. Last year, Jesse was the recipient of a Genomic Innovator Award given by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).",Patrick Lansdon
