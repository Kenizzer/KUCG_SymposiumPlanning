# KUGC_SymposiumPlanning

This repository contains templates and final versions of materials from past KUGC symposia:

* SymposiumPlanning_Timeline_Overview.xlsx provides a timeline for planning each aspect of the symposium.
* More detailed information specific to past symposia are in year-specific directories

**NOTE: Content cannot be viewed directly on Github. To view content, download a copy of the repository as described below**

## How to use this repository:

Information stored here is intended to be used as a starting point for future symposia. In order to access these materials and add new materials, you will need to "fork" this repository and link it to your github account.

* Create a github account: https://github.com/
* Navigate to this repository: KUGC_SymposiumPlanning
* Click the "Fork" button near the top of the screen

These steps will create an independent copy of the original repository and will allow you to add new materials for future symposia.

### Adding new content with Github:

I recommend assigning one person from the organizing committee to manage and add content to the Github repository to prevent "traffic jams" (uploading the same information at the same time or by different names, etc.). Github allows you to upload files in bulk and one by one (by clicking "Add Files"), but it is easier to clone your forked repository to your desktop to make modifications. To do this: 

* Download Github Desktop from here: https://desktop.github.com 
* Move Github Desktop to your applications directory (Mac) or wherever your programs are stored (sorry windows, I'm not sure how this works for you)
* Open Github Desktop and sign in with your login information
* Clone the KUCG repository
* Add or edit files using your file manager navigator (finder on Mac, by default the repository is stored in the Documents directory)
* When finished modifying content, return to Github Desktop on your local computer
* Add a summary documenting your changes (near bottom left of window)
* Click Commit to main (near bottom left of window)
* Click Push to sync local changes with the online repository (near upper middle of window)

# If you don't want to interact with Github to access and add content:

* Download a zipped directory copy of the repository to your local computer
  * Click the green Code button
  * Click download zipped file
* Expand the directory on your local computer (if necessary) and store the directory wherever convenient.
* Add, access, modify files for the current symposium
* **When the symposium is over** compress your directory with year specific information and upload the zipped directory to the forked repository on Github that they can be used as reference for future symposia.
  * Click "add files"
  * Click "upload files"
  * Drag and drop your zipped symposium directory
  * Click "Commit changes" at the bottom of the screen
